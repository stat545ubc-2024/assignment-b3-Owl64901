Having a strong attention to detail, so that the Operations Manager and Founder don’t need to provide Quality Assurance or ask for more information.
Overall, making the Founder's day, weeks and months easier because you’re on top of yours and their workload, you communicate effectively, you don’t add extra tasks to their plate and you are continuously seeking out learning opportunities so you can continue to expand your job role, responsibilities and knowledge.

The additional scope we provide falls into 3 categories:
Impact focused - While we do provide professional and personal development resources, they are all framed in terms of helping members maximize their positive Impact on the world, not simply business/career success or general happinessGlobally oriented - Spirit of the Game is one of the fastest growing NGOs in the world right now, adding 50-100 volunteer each week, meaning that when you join our network, you gain access to other members and experts all over the world, not just a handful of countriesEmpowerment centric- We don't want our members simply to be students, we also want to empower them to take the skills and mindsets they learn from our experts and pass them on to others

While SpiritoftheGame.org is 4 years old, each of our divisions operate autonomously, so TIBN is essentially start-up which doesn't wish to be beholden to investors who might change their priorities if the economy goes south.So we do need to bring in the revenue before we can start paying you.

Estimated time commitment we are looking for while this is a volunteer position is 8-12 hours a week. You will also have considerable discretion if you wish to bring in additional people from your existing professional network for any of our open City Chairpersons positions in other cities or for City Director roles on your own team.
TIBN is a part of the World Spirit of the Game Foundation, an international NGO which was formed to help individuals and organizations take Personal Accountability for maximizing their positive Impact on the world.We're launching the TIBN online community with 4-6 online events each month this winter, and are now starting in-person chapters and Retreats as well.

Required Education

4 Year Degree

ESA is seeking a dynamic and engaging World Language teacher to teach Middle and Upper School Spanish and French. The World Language Department at ESA is structured around the intensive study of French and Spanish. Instruction within the department includes not only the usual skills of reading, writing, and listening, but introduces an entirely new way of speaking. Proper use of intonation, appropriate facial expressions, and gestures inherent to native speakers are emphasized along with the obvious use of new sets of vocabulary and grammatical structures.

Instruction is through the immersion method; limited English is spoken in the class after the first few weeks. Grammatical structure is taught orally throughout the curriculum, as required by given situations, rather than in a structured series of exercises. The ultimate goal of the study of world language at ESA is to demonstrate that a world language can become a natural means of communication and an integral part of life.

The ideal candidate will engage students in a variety of ways to engender enthusiasm for the lessons, and he/she will embrace the idea of the immersion method. A Bachelor's degree is required, and a Master's degree is preferred. Ideal candidates should have a high degree of fluency in both Spanish and French (at least Advanced on the ACTFL proficiency level or at least B2 on the DELF framework).
